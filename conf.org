#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes

This is my emacs init written in org mode. In order to avoid a ton of problems, this file, =conf.org=, gets tangled and loaded as =conf.el=. =init.el= is an already existing emacs lisp file that initialises the =straight.el= package manager, loads a new version of org-mode, then tangles and loads this file, removing the need for any kind of bootstrapping and allowing the config to be cloned and run out of the box.

* Init GC Settings

We set GC settings to better values for init now, and then reset them to saner values later.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (eval-and-compile
    (setq gc-cons-threshold 402653184
          gc-cons-percentage 0.6))
#+END_SRC

Also the compiler to keep quiet about free vars and the like, which will inevitably pop up on compilation with all the packages we use.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq byte-compile-warnings '(not free-vars unresolved noruntime lexical make-local))
#+END_SRC

* Local Lisp Files
Sometimes you start emacs from a shortcut, and it'll put itself in the wrong directory. This starts us in home.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq default-directory (concat (getenv "HOME") "/"))
  (when (not (boundp 'user-emacs-directory))
    (setq user-emacs-directory "~/.emacs.d/"))
#+END_SRC

The =custom-file= must be set so as not to pollute our init.el with =custom-set-definitions=.
In the =/lisp= directory I keep any standalone lisp files, such as major and minor modes I wrote.
=/colors= has any custom color schemes I've picked up that don't exist in melpa.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory  "custom.el"))
  (load custom-file)
  (add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "lisp/"))
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (concat user-emacs-directory "colors/"))
#+END_SRC

* Package Manager
   We now use a combination of use-package and straight.el to manage packages. This gives a nice functional/declarative style of package management. Way better than trying to remember what is installed on which computer, and having to constantly call =package-install-selected-packages= on every new machine.

   +This is the bootstrap code for straight.el+ Due to org autoloading reasons, we have to put the bootstrap code for straight.el into =init.el=

    I also want to set up =use-package=, which works in conjuntion with =straight.el=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-defer t)
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)

  (defvar personal-keybindings)
#+END_SRC

* Editor
  Here we configure the emacs text editor itself, the old fashioned bitch. Lots of this is just disabling menu bars, scroll bars, bells, cursors yada yada yada...
** Appearance
*** Theme and Font
First we'll install the theme packages. I'm a fan of light themes for several reasons, both scientific and superstitous. First see [[https://www.quora.com/Is-dark-mode-light-text-on-a-dark-background-really-better-for-the-eyes/answer/Alan-Kay-11][this]] from Alan Kay himself on the topic, as well as many others providing further medical proof that lighter backgrounds are easier on the eyes, unless you live in a hikki nest bedroom. But being human I'm not one to blindly (lol) make decisions based purely on logical reasoning.
The second reason is a more illogical, human one. I find that using a light theme puts my mind in a different state to a dark one, treating my editor and its text as a purer interface, a kind of smart[ish] paper or perhaps an Alto or LMI Lambda, something to be cared for, rather than the spammy, beeping, ugly font VGA terminals that a white on black theme reminds me of.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package tao-theme)     ;; for tao-yang
  (use-package gruvbox-theme) ;; for gruvbox-light-soft
  (use-package acme-theme
    :init
    ;; variables to configure
    (setq acme-theme-gray-rainbow-delimiters nil)
    (setq acme-theme-more-syntax-hl t))

  (use-package parchment-theme
    :init (load-theme 'parchment))
#+END_SRC

**** Obsolete Theme picker
Theme picker. I can add themes I like the the list =tk/themes= and choose from them when I want. I realised I changed themes quite a lot, not least in the morning and evening I switch between a light and dark theme.
    
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (defvar tk/themes '(
			    ;; Dark Themes
			    base16-atlas
			    purple-haze
			    soothe

			    ;; Light Themes
			    base16-atelier-estuary-light
			    parchment
			    plan9
			    anti-zenburn))

  (require 'fringe)
  
  (defun tk/pick-theme ()
    "Present a list of themes for user to pick"
    (interactive)
    (ivy-read
     "Pick theme:"
     tk/themes 
     :require-match t
     ;; :initial-input (car custom-enabled-themes)
     :action (lambda (theme)
	       (progn
		 (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
		 (load-theme (intern theme) t)
		 (fringe-mode 'minimal)))
     :update-fn (lambda ()
		  (progn (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
			 (load-theme (nth ivy--index tk/themes) t)
			 (fringe-mode 0)))))
#+END_SRC

Setting the font is pretty self explanatory. Iosevka is a nice tall font, has good programming stuff like distinguishing 0 and O, and has ligature support (although emacs is still a lil behind on automatic ligature support.) We'll also include =all-the-icons=, which some packages will use only if it is installed.

*** UI Simplifying
This sections a doozy. Welcome to emacs in the 21st century. Basically we just have to disable all the ugly stuff emacs has by default, like menu bars. Who needs 'em; I have M-x, I have keybinds. Visible bell aka /SHUT THE FUCK UP EMACS/, inhibit startup because I know I'm using /"GNU Emacs, one component of the GNU/Linux operating system"/, turn off scroll bars and the weird fringes. Also =doom-modeline= makes the modeline look all nice.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Workflow
Now we get to the good stuff. Here we'll set some useful variables for all org functions. Org directory where I keep all my org files. 
My system uses time management features like the /agenda/, =org-capture=, some /GTD/ concepts, and a combo of /Orglzy/ and /Syncthing/ to provide a comprehensive, multiplatform, planning system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq tk/org-directory "~/doc/org/")
  (setq tk/org-file-list
        `(,@(file-expand-wildcards (concat tk/org-directory "*.org"))))
#+END_SRC

We should modify the /TODO/ keywords to add a 'NEXT' keyword. This means a task is ongoing, and ideally should be finished before others are started.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq org-todo-keywords 
        '((sequence "TODO" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" )))
#+END_SRC

=inbox.org= serves as a place for captured ideas to go. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-default-notes-file (concat tk/org-directory "inbox.org"))
#+END_SRC

Once notes are captured to inbox.org, they must be /processed/. I will add any extra details such as deadlines, time to complete, and priority, then /refile/ them to their relevant org heading. Since all org files can be related in any weird number of ways, we shouldn't limit ourselves to only a small amount of targets. All org files (at least all in the org directory) are included, albeit only to a single heading level (for now).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-refile-targets
        (mapcar (lambda (e) `(,e . (:maxlevel . 2)))
                tk/org-file-list))
  (setq org-refile-use-outline-path 'file)
#+END_SRC

Sometimes I wanna use /pomodoro technique/.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package 'org-pomodoro)
#+END_SRC

** Agenda 
The same principle applies to /agenda/. We should be able to put /TODO/ headings in any org file, for any project, and have them be added to the agenda. We can filter through these in the agenda config.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-files tk/org-file-list)
#+END_SRC

The org agenda page is the heart of the entire system. Assuming all the org files are in place, and the headings are processed correctly, this should be a beautiful dashboard to manage tasks from. Largely copied from [[https://gist.github.com/jethrokuan/78936a44f249e2c1a61b5184669a32d7][this gist]] (look up the rest of Jethro Kuans stuff on this though, he's got it down).

It's also important to handle idle time. I sometimes forget I'm clocked in, or something high priority comes up and I forget to clock out. Setting an idle time variable will tell org to prompt you after n minutes have passed without any input, asking what to do with the time spent doing 'nothing'. ~Of course some tasks aren't doable in emacs,~ glorious macOS will measure any activity on the system. Still doesn't apply for offline tasks. That could be time spent working offline, and you can just tell org to add it to the clock all the same.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-clock-idle-timer 15)

We'll also do some minor theming to tidy it up.

Capturing is key to the process. Ideas can come about anywhere, anytime. Being able to quickly jot your idea down for later processing means you don't have to worry about sacrificing your current task or your forgetting your idea.
Right now there's only one capture template, /i/, which adds the idea to the inbox file with /TODO/ prefixed.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Blog
Org mode can also be used as a blog creation platform. I can write and keep blog posts locally, and then publish them to a webserver in HTML format. We publish using the =org-publish= settings in the next heading.

** Site Publishing
Pusblishing my website. Written in org files and published to HTML/Gemini. Will replace Blog.

But first we'll have to quickly pull in an org-mode gemini exporter. I was writing my own, but Justin Abrahms version is pretty good.

* Languages
Finally we've transformed the ancient magicks of emacs from a 50 year old dusty old expensive typewriter into an elegant tool to weave the fabric of code. Or something. Now we can get to our language specific config and hooks. 

** Company Mode
Most of these languages provide a company mode completion system. We'll just make sure the latest version is installed here so we don't have to worry about it somwhere else.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package 'company)
#+END_SRC

** C/C++
The siblings who don't want to be associated with each other, lumped in to the same hook once again. By default emacs formats C in a bizarre GNU way. Cool, but not for me. Or whoever else has to read my C code.

The mode hook is to set up eglot, but since that's proved very difficult in OS dev stuff, and my main C programming is for OS dev, I just disabled it until I can be bothered.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq c-default-style "linux"
	c-basic-offset 4)

  (defun tk/c-c++-hook ()
    "Personal C/C++ hook."
    (setq company-backends
	  (cons 'company-capf
		(remove 'company-capf company-backends)))
    (eglot-ensure))
